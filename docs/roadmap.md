# Healthic Roadmap

## Completed

- [x] Chat interface with AI health coach
- [x] Goal decomposition (breaks goals into weekly milestones)
- [x] Pattern detection (finds trends in user behavior)
- [x] Opik integration (traces all conversations)
- [x] LLM-as-judge evaluations (actionability, personalization, safety)
- [x] Online evaluation (scores every response in background)
- [x] Experiment runner with 13 test cases

## Next Up

- [ ] **Automatic preference extraction** - Extract user constraints and preferences from conversation (e.g., "I'm vegetarian" → store in database) using an extraction LLM call
- [ ] Proactive check-ins - Agent reaches out when user misses patterns
- [ ] Conversation persistence - Save chat history across sessions
- [ ] User profile page - Show extracted preferences, let user edit them

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Vector search for past conversations
- [ ] Tone calibration based on user mood
- [ ] Weekly progress summaries
- [ ] Integration with fitness trackers
